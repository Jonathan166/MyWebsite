                    projects to showcase to potential employers. Please take a look around and feel free to post any comments or questions you may have.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 70px">Progress = Happiness is a wonderful belief I'm referencing from Anthony Robbins. I attended one of his seminars years ago and have lived by this belief ever since.</p>

                <p>Build Yourself daily. That's right. Work on yourself daily, mentally and physically. If you are going to watch TV then watch a documentary or something educational.
                Not the news. Taking small productive steps daily will have a massive impact on your well being.</p>

                <p>Projects in Progress. Setup projects to work on. I find rather than watching instructional videos on how to learn something, have a endgame in mind.
                For example, rather then learning HTML through videos, plan to build a website. Having this goal gives you drive and something to strive for.</p>
